# my-portfolio


Hello there!

This will be my first ever portfolio project. I will use this project to showcase future projects that I will be working on.

As of, January 4th 2020, I've set a goal to dedicate 2 hours a day to studying/coding projects so that I can confidently say that I know  Front end development.

My focus is currently
Javascript
CSS3


Current problem solving issue I have as of right now is Gulp not sourcing my scss files to compile to my main css file.
